A rat was stuck in the tar laid on the road. Since it was night, the driver in the car couldn't see the rat. The cat in the car laid an act as it was about to taste the rat. It was so dusty outside that car was not in a state to stop. The car skid and the driver broke his elbow and chin. The rat was still alive below the car, an inch from the tyre. The rat was stressed and cried. On the other hand, the cat knew the only thing missing was cider to make the desserts.
