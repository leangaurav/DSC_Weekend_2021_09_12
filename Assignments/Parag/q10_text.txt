Otto wants to have a dog. He walks up the street and is about to step into the pets store when he sees a sign that reads ‘Step on no pets’ hanging on the door. Otto finds a dog in his radar. He lowers himself to the dog's level. Otto asks the owner, "Madam, how much for the dog?". The owner agrees to trade the dog with a racecar. Defied by the logic Otto buys a kayak and attaches a rotor to it and goes to the owner.
